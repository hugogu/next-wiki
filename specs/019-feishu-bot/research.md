# Research: Feishu Bot Integration

## R1 — Inbound event transport, authenticity, and replay handling

**Decision**: Use the Feishu SDK WebSocket long connection in the web process.
Register the message dispatcher during application instrumentation and persist an
inbox/deduplication record before asynchronous processing: use `message_id` for
`im.message.receive_v1` and `event_id` for other v2 events, namespaced by tenant
and event type. Retain the deduplication record for at least 24 hours and
acknowledge a duplicate as a successful no-op.

**Rationale**: Feishu documents at-least-once event delivery and retries through
its SDK connection. A durable inbox prevents repeat binding, repeated LLM work,
and duplicate cards across web-app restarts. The outbound connection avoids a
public callback endpoint, Encrypt Key, and Verification Token while retaining a
single in-process module and no inter-process contract.

**Alternatives considered**:

- Separate long-running bot process with a private HTTP delegation contract —
  rejected. It adds a second image/process, an inter-process trust boundary, and
  a shared service credential for no functional gain now that the callback can
  be an in-process route. Collapsing it into the web app is simpler (P1/KISS).
- HTTP callback transport — rejected because it requires public ingress plus
  Encrypt Key and Verification Token configuration even after the QR flow.
- A separate WebSocket worker — rejected because the SDK connection can run in
  the existing web process with the same durable inbox and worker recovery.
- In-memory deduplication — rejected because restarts and multiple web replicas
  reintroduce duplicate processing.

## R2 — Permission-safe group behavior

**Decision**: Support two explicit group subscription modes:

- `public_safe`: post a group card only when the event resource remains publicly
  readable at delivery time. A page title/path/link is rendered only after that
  check.
- `private_recipients`: use the group solely to select potential recipients;
  enumerate current members when the operator has granted the required Feishu
  scope, map active bindings, re-check wiki permission per recipient, and send
  protected details only through direct messages. Never post a protected summary,
  title, URL, count, or failure explanation to the group.

AI-action completion is a direct notification to the action actor's active
binding. Group questions use only the @-mention sender's binding; the response is
direct when it would disclose page content.

**Rationale**: Bot membership or the ability to post in a chat does not establish
that every chat member may read a Wiki resource. This preserves group
subscriptions without creating an alternate, weaker authorization model.

**Alternatives considered**:

- Broadcast every configured event to the group — rejected because titles, links,
  action outcomes, and transfer state are protected metadata.
- Require every group member to bind and grant access before every group card —
  rejected as an unnecessary advanced Feishu permission for public notifications;
  private delivery instead fans out only to eligible bound recipients.
- Drop group subscriptions — rejected because it removes requested functionality.

## R3 — In-process delegation (bound-user attribution)

**Decision**: Resolve delegation entirely in-process. The SDK event handler hands a
validated, deduplicated command to a Feishu delegation service in the same
process. That service looks up the active binding for the Feishu `open_id`,
builds the bound user's normal `PermCtx` with `buildUserCtx`, calls the existing
`createWikiQuestion(ctx, input)` service, tags the action with Feishu request
metadata, and records `origin=feishu`. There is no service credential, no
caller-supplied user id, and no HTTP hop — the effective user is derived only
from the confirmed binding.

**Rationale**: `createWikiQuestion(ctx, input)` and the existing worker already
preserve `actorUserId`, re-check the active user and AI entitlement, and retrieve
under a normal permission context. Calling them directly from the same process
reuses those correct paths without introducing a second process, a private HTTP
API, or an impersonation token that would turn a compromise into arbitrary user
impersonation.

**Alternatives considered**:

- Private service-to-service HTTP contract with a bot service token — rejected as
  unnecessary indirection now that the caller is in-process; it added a
  credential to manage and an internal API surface to secure.
- Store a Wiki API key per Feishu binding — rejected for secret proliferation,
  revocation complexity, and actor ambiguity.
- Generic service token plus caller-supplied `userId` — rejected because it turns
  a token compromise into arbitrary user impersonation.

**Local evidence**:

- `apps/web/app/api/ai/questions/route.ts`
- `apps/web/src/server/services/ai-question.ts`
- `apps/web/src/server/jobs/ai-question.ts`
- `apps/web/src/server/permissions/index.ts`

## R4 — Durable notification and answer delivery

**Decision**: Use PostgreSQL notification-event and delivery rows as the source
of truth, with the existing pg-boss infrastructure waking/scheduling in-process
workers registered through `registerJobs`. Create the event/outbox row
transactionally with the business transition where possible. A delivery worker
claims due rows, re-checks the binding, subscription, and authorization
immediately before rendering, sends one message through the in-process Feishu
transport, and atomically records the outcome. Grounded Q&A answers reuse the
same outbox: when a `wiki_question` action completes, a delivery row targeting
the asker's binding is created and sent by the same worker. Delivery is
at-least-once, with a unique `(event_id, subscription_id, recipient)` key,
deterministic outgoing request UUID (the delivery id), exponential backoff from
15 seconds to 5 minutes, five attempts, and stale-claim recovery on boot.
Records expire after the configured retention window (72 hours default, 24–168
configurable) with an explicit `expired` status.

**Rationale**: the pg-boss facade may safely no-op when workers are unavailable;
it cannot be the durable notification source. Existing storage-replication rows
already demonstrate the required persistent status/attempt/availability/unique
pattern, and `registerJobs` already boots stale-work recovery for other
features — the Feishu workers slot into that same seam.

**Alternatives considered**:

- pg-boss only — rejected because an unavailable queue can lose the wake-up and
  there is no administrator-visible delivery lifecycle.
- Exactly-once external delivery — rejected because a network failure after Feishu
  accepts a send cannot be distinguished from a failed send. At-least-once plus
  deterministic idempotency is the reliable bounded guarantee.
- A separate delivery poller process — rejected; the existing in-process job
  runner already provides scheduling, batching, and boot recovery.

**Local evidence**:

- `apps/web/src/server/jobs/runtime.ts`
- `apps/web/src/server/jobs/register.ts`
- `apps/web/src/server/db/schema/index.ts` (`storageReplicationTasks`)
- `apps/web/src/server/services/git-export.ts`

## R5 — Secrets, audit provenance, and retention

**Decision**: Encrypt the Feishu app secret with the existing
AES-256-GCM key-encryption primitive. Configuration input is write-only and
output exposes only `hasSecret` / masked identity. The web app decrypts these
in-process when opening the long connection and sending messages. Extend audit
entries with a bounded origin and an external correlation identifier; use
`feishu` plus a non-secret event/message correlation value. Do not put raw
questions, answers, credentials, or Feishu IDs in the audit metadata. Expire bot
sessions immediately on unbind/revocation and retain delivery/session records
only through their documented TTLs.

**Rationale**: current encrypted storage configurations and AI-action retention
already establish patterns that meet this feature's needs. The current audit
schema lacks a queryable source/channel and therefore cannot satisfy FR-018/FR-027
without extension. Keeping credentials in the encrypted DB config (not process
env) means the admin UI remains the single source of truth and the same in-process
code both stores and consumes them.

**Alternatives considered**:

- Plaintext app secret with a masked UI — rejected because masking does not protect
  the database, backups, or logs.
- Credentials in process environment variables — rejected because it splits the
  source of truth from the admin-managed encrypted config and complicates rotation.
- Encode `feishu` in an audit path or entry type — rejected because origin remains
  ambiguous and unqueryable.

**Local evidence**:

- `apps/web/src/server/crypto/key-encryption.ts`
- `apps/web/src/server/services/audit.ts`
- `apps/web/src/server/db/schema/index.ts` (`apiAuditEntries`, `aiActions`)

## R6 — Deployment and rate limiting

**Decision**: Ship the integration inside the existing `web` service. The Feishu
SDK is a web-app dependency; it opens an outbound WebSocket from application
instrumentation; workers run on the existing job runner. There is no callback
route or ingress requirement. Default
startup is unchanged and needs no Feishu credentials — the module is inert until
configured. Start with Wiki-protective in-process defaults of 10 accepted Q&A
requests per bound user per minute and 30 per chat per minute, while the outbound
sender also enforces Feishu's 5 QPS per-recipient and per-group constraints.

**Rationale**: this is the strongest possible fit for Constitution P1: no new
container, Compose profile, port, process, or stateful service. PostgreSQL plus
pg-boss already provide the durable-state and scheduling primitives. The
conservative Q&A limits protect the LLM/action queue independently of Feishu's
message-send limits.

**Alternatives considered**:

- Separate `feishu` Compose profile / bot container — rejected; it grew the
  deployment footprint and added an inter-process boundary the in-process module
  makes unnecessary.
- HTTP callback transport — rejected because it requires a public callback URL
  and manual event-security setup after QR registration.
- Add Redis or a broker — rejected because PostgreSQL plus pg-boss already meet
  the durable-state requirement and P1 prohibits a new default stateful service.

## R7 — QR app association and creation

**Decision**: Offer an administrator-initiated Feishu device-code registration
flow from `/admin/feishu`, modelled on OpenClaw's Feishu plugin. The web app
calls `https://accounts.feishu.cn/oauth/v1/app/registration` to initialize and
begin a `PersonalAgent` / `client_secret` flow, renders the returned
`verification_uri_complete` as a QR code, and polls once per browser-scheduled
interval. The browser receives no device code. A short-lived PostgreSQL row
holds only AES-256-GCM-encrypted `device_code`; on completion the server writes
the returned App ID and App Secret through the existing write-only encrypted
configuration service and immediately enables the WebSocket connection. There is
no manual-credential fallback in the administrator UI.

**Rationale**: this produces the same native Feishu experience as OpenClaw:
the mobile app presents the administrator with the choice to associate an
existing app or create a new one. Persisting the short-lived encrypted state
survives a web-app restart and keeps the device credential out of the browser,
without a second process, worker, or container. The SDK's outbound WebSocket
does not need a callback URL, Encrypt Key, or Verification Token, so a completed
QR flow can enable the integration automatically.

**Alternatives considered**:

- Claim that the QR flow can create a bot without a server-side device-code
  exchange — rejected because the resulting App Secret must not be exposed to
  the client.
- Store the device code in an HTTP-only cookie or process memory — rejected
  because it is fragile across restarts and cannot be safely recovered on a
  multi-replica deployment.
- Use a third-party QR image endpoint — rejected because it unnecessarily
  discloses the verification URL; render locally instead.
